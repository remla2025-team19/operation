# Continuous Experimentation: Combined Model Optimization & UI Enhancement

## Hypothesis
**Version v2 combining optimized model threshold (0.65) with improved color scheme will increase overall user engagement by 30% and improve prediction accuracy perception, measured by active user sessions, prediction usage rates, and user interaction patterns, while maintaining system performance.**

## Experiment Design
- **Control Group (v1)**: Current application with threshold 0.75 + existing color scheme (90% traffic)
- **Treatment Group (v2)**: Optimized application with threshold 0.65 + improved color scheme (10% traffic)
- **Duration**: 7 days
- **Sample Size**: 1000+ user sessions per version daily

## Combined Changes in v2
1. **Model Optimization**: Reduced prediction threshold from 0.75 to 0.65 for faster responses
2. **UI Enhancement**: Improved color scheme with better contrast ratios and modern design
3. **User Experience**: Combined effect of faster predictions and better visual appeal

## Metrics Tracked (Using Existing Dashboard)
1. **Active Users**: `sentiment_app_active_users` - Primary engagement metric
2. **Request Rate**: `rate(sentiment_app_requests_total[1m])` - User interaction frequency
3. **Predictions by Sentiment**: `sentiment_app_predictions_total` - Feature usage and sentiment distribution
4. **Request Duration**: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(sentiment_app_request_duration_seconds_bucket[$interval])) by (le, endpoint))` - Performance impact

## Decision Criteria
**Accept v2 if:**
- **User Engagement**: Active users increase by ≥30% compared to v1 baseline
- **Feature Usage**: Prediction requests increase by ≥25% indicating higher user interaction
- **Performance Maintained**: P95 request duration remains ≤ 500ms (no degradation)
- **Balanced Sentiment Distribution**: Prediction results show similar sentiment distribution patterns (validating model accuracy)
- **Sustained Engagement**: Request rate per active user increases by ≥20%

## Implementation Details
- **Sticky Sessions**: Implemented via `consistentHash` on `X-User` header for consistent user experience
- **Canary Routing**: 90/10 split using Istio VirtualService weights
- **Version Consistency**: DestinationRules ensure consistent model-app version pairing
- **Experiment Targeting**: `X-Experiment: canary` header for direct v2 access
- **Combined Optimization**: v2 uses both `predictionThreshold: 0.65` and enhanced UI colors

## Metrics Analysis Framework

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Active Users Growth**: Monitor `sentiment_app_active_users` gauge for sustained user base expansion
- **Prediction Engagement**: Track `sentiment_app_predictions_total` rate to measure feature adoption
- **User Interaction Intensity**: Analyze `rate(sentiment_app_requests_total[1m])` per active user

### Performance Validation
- **Response Time**: Ensure `histogram_quantile(0.95, ...)` shows improved or maintained performance
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Validate model accuracy through balanced sentiment result patterns

### Dashboard Visualization
The Grafana dashboard provides real-time comparison across:
1. **Active Users Panel**: Gauge showing concurrent users by version
2. **Request Rate Panel**: Time series comparing interaction patterns
3. **Predictions by Sentiment Panel**: Feature usage and accuracy validation
4. **Request Duration Panel**: Performance impact assessment

## Decision Process
1. **Monitor for 7 days** to collect comprehensive user behavior data
2. **Analyze active user growth** - accept if v2 shows ≥30% increase in active users
3. **Evaluate prediction usage** - measure if combined improvements drive ≥25% more predictions
4. **Validate performance** - ensure P95 duration doesn't exceed 500ms baseline
5. **Assess sentiment distribution** - confirm model accuracy through balanced results
6. **Calculate engagement intensity** - verify request rate per user increases by ≥20%
7. **Make data-driven decision** based on comprehensive dashboard metrics

## Expected Outcomes
The combined v2 improvements are expected to:
- **Faster User Experience**: Lower model threshold reduces prediction latency
- **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: Improved colors increase user satisfaction and retention
- **Higher Feature Adoption**: Combined improvements drive more prediction requests
- **Sustained Engagement**: Better UX leads to longer sessions and repeat usage
- **Maintained Accuracy**: Threshold adjustment doesn't compromise prediction quality

## Risk Mitigation
- **Sticky sessions** ensure consistent user experience during experiment
- **Gradual rollout** (10%) limits exposure to potential issues
- **Multi-metric validation** prevents false positives from single metric improvements
- **Performance monitoring** ensures system stability under optimization changes

This experiment design leverages the synergy between model optimization and UI enhancement while using your existing Grafana dashboard metrics to provide comprehensive evaluation of the combined improvements' impact on user engagement and system performance.
